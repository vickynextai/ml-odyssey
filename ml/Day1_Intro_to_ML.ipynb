    "- **Definition:** A type of ML where the training data has **inputs (X) and labeled outputs (Y)**. The model learns a mapping function `f: X â†’ Y`.  \n",
    "- **Goal:** Predict outputs for new, unseen inputs.  \n",
    "- **Examples:**  \n",
    "  - **Regression:** Predict continuous values (e.g., house prices, temperature).  \n",
    "  - **Classification:** Predict discrete labels (e.g., spam vs not spam, disease present vs not present).  \n",

    "- **Goal:** Find patterns, clusters, or reduce dimensionality.  \n",
    "- **Examples:**  \n",
    "  - **Clustering:** Grouping customers by shopping habits.  \n",
