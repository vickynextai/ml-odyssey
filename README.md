# 🚀 ML Odyssey

Welcome to **ML Odyssey** – my curated journey of mastering **Machine Learning** through hands-on projects, experiments, and real-world problem solving.  
This repository reflects my continuous learning path and growth mindset as I work towards becoming an expert ML Engineer.  

---

## 🧭 Mission
- To build a **strong foundation in ML** (Math + Python + Core Algorithms).  
- To create **production-ready ML projects** that solve real-world problems.  
- To showcase a **structured learning journey** that recruiters and peers can track.  
- To align with my long-term vision → **Mission 50 LPA 🚀**

## 📌 Roadmap

### 1. Python & Math Foundation
- Data Structures & Algorithms in Python  
- Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Statistics & Probability for ML  
- Linear Algebra, Calculus basics  

### 2. Core Machine Learning
- Supervised Learning → Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forests  
- Unsupervised Learning → KMeans, Hierarchical Clustering, PCA  
- Model Evaluation → Cross Validation, GridSearchCV, Hyperparameter Tuning  

### 3. Advanced Topics
- Feature Engineering & Data Preprocessing  
- Ensemble Methods (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)  
- Intro to Deep Learning (Neural Nets, TensorFlow/PyTorch basics)  

### 4. Projects (Hands-On)
- 📊 **Sales Prediction** – Regression problem on structured data  
- 🔍 **Spam Detection** – Classification with NLP  
- 🖼️ **Image Classifier** – CNN-based deep learning model  
- ⚡ **Real-time ML App** – Deployed with FastAPI/Streamlit
